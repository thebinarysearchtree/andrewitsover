        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Thank you for using Quietone. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our application.</p>
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Quietone does not send any information over the network. Everything is performed locally. The only exception is when an AI model is first needed for transcribing. In this case, the model is downloaded from the web. No personal information is sent with this request.</p>
        <p>The only reason this request is needed is because models are quite large and therefore not appropriate for including in the initial installation process.</p>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information from the users of our app. The app does not require you to provide any personal data, and we do not track, store, or collect any information about your usage patterns.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our App does not integrate with any third-party services in a way that could allow them to collect any personal information.</p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us via our contact form at https://andrewitsover.com/quietone/contact</p>
